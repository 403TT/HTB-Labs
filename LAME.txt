#Lab [LAME] <Beginner> TARGET: 10.10.10.3

1. How many of the nmap top 1000 TCP ports are open on the remote host?
  nmap 10.10.10.3
  ^ basic command - searching ports on the Target IP. Identified [4]

2. What version of VSFTPd is running on Lame?
   ftp 10.10.10.3
   There are different ways to detect VSFTPd versions - something like <VSFTPd -version> only really works if you 
   have local access.
   I connected directly to the ftp using the above command. This shows the VSFTPd version in the banner.
   
3. What version of Samba is running on Lame? Give the numbers up to but not including "-Debian".
  smbclient -L //10.10.10.3 -N
  Tried running [nmap -sV -p 445 10.10.10.3] results show 3.X - 4.X - nmap couldn't detect the exact version
